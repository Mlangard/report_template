@inproceedings{Juan-C.-Garcia:2010fk,
	Abstract = {The present work represents working progress for designing a Graphical User Interface (GUI) within an ongoing research project named RAUVI (e.g. Reconfigurable AUV for Intervention Missions). This GUI should help the user to identify the target using images compiled by the I-AUV through a previous survey stage. After that, the user is able to specify the most suitable intervention task selected among a set of predefined ones. Thus, a very intuitive and user-friendly interface has been designed, enabling a non qualified user to succeed in the specification of an intervention mission. Furthermore, some implementation details and their performance about different facilities integrated within this GUI to assist the user in the required specification of underwater intervention missions will be addressed.},

	Abstract = {Odometry is the most widely used method for determining the momentary position of a mobile robot. This paper introduces practical methods for measuring and reducing odometry errors that are caused by the two dominant error sources in differential-drive mobile robots: 1) uncertainty about the effective wheelbase; and 2) unequal wheel diameters. These errors stay almost constant over prolonged periods of time. Performing an occasional calibration as proposed here will increase the odometric accuracy of the robot and reduce operation cost because an accurate mobile robot requires fewer absolute positioning updates. Many manufacturers or end-users calibrate their robots, usually in a time-consuming and nonsystematic trial and error approach. By contrast, the method described in this paper is systematic, provides near-optimal results, and it can be performed easily and without complicated equipment. Experimental results are presented that show a consistent improvement of at least one order of magnitude in odometric accuracy (with respect to systematic errors) for a mobile robot calibrated with our method},

	Abstract = {Accurate registration in an augmented reality system requires accurate trackers. An electronic compass can be a valuable sensor in an outdoor augmented reality system because it provides absolute heading estimates. However, compasses are vulnerable to distortion caused by environmental disturbances to Earth's magnetic field. These disturbances vary with geographic location and are not trivial to model. Static calibration methods exist but these require an explicit initial calibration step and do not adapt to changing distortion patterns. This paper describes in detail an autocalibration method that compensates for changing compass distortions. With minimal user input, it automatically measures and adjusts the calibration table used to correct the compass output. Autocalibration uses redundant heading information computed from rate gyroscopes. We demonstrate that autocalibration converges to solutions similar to a distortion table that was manually measured with a mechanical turntable. With autocalibration, an electronic compass can provide useful measurements even as the user walks around through areas of varying magnetic distortion},

	Abstract = {We consider the self-calibration problem for perspective cameras and especially the classical Kruppa equation approach. It is known that for several common types of camera motion, self-calibration is degenerate, which manifests itself through the existence of ambiguous solutions. The author previously (1997, 1999) studied these critical motion sequences and showed their importance for practical applications. Here, we reveal a type of camera motion that is not critical for the generic self-calibration problem, but for which the Kruppa equation approach fails. This is the case if the optical centers of all cameras lie on a sphere and if the optical axes pass through the sphere's center, a very natural situation for 3D object modeling from images. Results of simulated experiments demonstrate the instability of numerical self-calibration algorithms in near-degenerate configurations.},

For that, we select six combinations of moments to control the six degrees of freedom of the system. These features are particularly adequate, if we consider a planar object and the configurations such that the object and camera planes are parallel at the desired position. The experimental results we present show that a correct behavior of the system is obtained if we consider either a simple symmetrical object or a planar object with complex and unknown shape.},

In this paper, we present improvements in image-based visual servo using image moments. First, the analytical form of the interaction matrix related to the moments computed from a set of coplanar points is derived, and we show that it is different from the form obtained previously, using coplanar closed contours. Six visual features are selected to design a decoupled control scheme when the object is parallel to the image plane. This nice property is then generalized to the case where the desired object position is not parallel to the image plane.

	Abstract = {Classical sensor-based approaches tend to constrain all the degrees of freedom of a robot during the execution of a task. In this paper, a new solution is proposed. The key idea is to divide the global full-constraining task into several subtasks, which can be applied or inactivated to take into account potential constraints of the environment. Far from any constraint, the robot moves according to the full task. When it comes closer to a configuration to avoid, a higher level controller removes one or several subtasks, and activates them again when the constraint is avoided. The last controller ensures the convergence at the global level by introducing some look-ahead capabilities when a local minimum is reached. The robot accomplishes the global task by automatically sequencing sensor-based tasks, obstacle avoidance, and short deliberative phases. In this paper, a complete solution to implement this idea is proposed, along with several experiments that prove the validity of this approach},

	Abstract = {We propose an approach to vision-based robot control, called 2�D visual servoing, which avoids the respective drawbacks of classical position-based and image-based visual servoing. Contrary to the position-based visual servoing, our scheme does not need any geometric three-dimensional model of the object. Furthermore and contrary to image-based visual servoing, our approach ensures the convergence of the control law in the whole task space. 2�D visual servoing is based on the estimation of the partial camera displacement from the current to the desired camera poses at each iteration of the control law. Visual features and data extracted from the partial displacement allow us to design a decoupled control law controlling the six camera DOFs. The robustness of our visual servoing scheme with respect to camera calibration errors is also analyzed: the necessary and sufficient conditions for local asymptotic stability are easily obtained. Then, due to the simple structure of the system, sufficient conditions for global asymptotic stability are established. Finally, experimental results with an eye-in-hand robotic system confirm the improvement in the stability and convergence domain of the 2�D visual servoing with respect to classical position-based and image-based visual servoing},

@article{Moakher-SIAM02,
	Abstract = {In this paper we give precise definitions of different, properly invariant notions of mean or average rotation. Each mean is associated with a metric in SO(3). The metric induced from the Frobenius inner product gives rise to a mean rotation that is given by the closest special orthogonal matrix to the usual arithmetic mean of the given rotation matrices. The mean rotation associated with the intrinsic metric on SO(3) is the Riemannian center of mass of the given rotation matrices. We show that the Riemannian mean rotation shares many common features with the geometric mean of positive numbers and the geometric mean of positive Hermitian operators. We give some examples with closed-form solutions of both notions of mean.},
