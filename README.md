## Report

Latex (`report` folder) and work (`word` folder) are available.

For Latex, modify the file `thesisfront.tex` to set your name, thesis, jury, date, etc.
Same for the bibliography report/defense, add it in the front page if needed.

## Presentation

A beamer template is available in the `beamer` folder.

## Latex syntax example

In the `ieeeexample` folder is the full tex file of a IEEE article with the corresponding PDF. You can find many examples of syntaxes: equations, tables, algorithms, figures and multiple figures.

Feel free to modify and propose any improvements.
